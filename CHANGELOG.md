# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-23

Code-quality hardening pass — no new features, no behavior changes for existing users.

### Changed
- Expanded the `ruff` lint ruleset to include security (`S`), performance (`PERF`), unused-argument (`ARG`), complexity (`C901`), naming (`N`), pathlib (`PTH`), and ruff-specific (`RUF`) checks, with a per-path exception for `tests/` where bare `assert` and placeholder `/tmp/...` paths are the established idiom, not a real risk
- `DataContract.api_version` renamed from `apiVersion` (still aliased to the `apiVersion` YAML key — the contract format on disk is unchanged) for consistency with every other snake_case field, mirroring the existing `schema_`/`schema` alias
- `SQLReader.get_last_modified()` now quotes the dynamic column/table identifiers through SQLAlchemy's own `identifier_preparer` instead of raw f-string interpolation, and gained an explicit guard for a missing `table_name`
- Reduced `akad cli.py`'s `diff` command below the complexity threshold by extracting its argument-validation/loading logic into `_load_diff_contracts()`
- Various conciseness fixes surfaced by the expanded linting: comprehensions instead of manual append loops in `akad.differ` and the email notifier, `next()` instead of a single-element list slice in tests, dead `contract` parameter removed from `_build_email_body()`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `akad diff` CLI command — compares two contract versions (two local files, or two versions already published to the registry) and classifies every change as breaking or non-breaking for a consumer relying on the old contract
- `akad.differ` module exposing `diff_contracts()` for programmatic use
- `RegistryClient.get_contract_version(name, version)` — fetch a specific historical contract version, not just the current one

### Fixed
- CLI commands using the ✓/✗ status icons (`validate`, `check`, `history`, `diff`) could crash with `UnicodeEncodeError` on a non-UTF-8 console (e.g. the `cp1252` default on many Windows setups); output is now forced to UTF-8

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `akad infer` CLI command — profiles an existing dataset (Parquet or SQL) and scaffolds a starter contract YAML, with inferred schema, volume, and quality rules
- `akad.profiler` module exposing `profile_dataframe()` and `generate_contract()` for programmatic use

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

Initial release as `akad-framework`, renamed from the earlier `datacontract-framework` prototype.

### Added
- Core validation engine: schema, freshness, volume, and quality checks against Parquet and SQL datasets
- `DataContractValidator` SDK with file-based and registry-based contract loading
- FastAPI contract registry with PostgreSQL/SQLite backend
- FastAPI + Jinja2 + Tailwind observability dashboard
- Webhook and email breach notifiers
- `akad` CLI: `check`, `publish`, `validate`, `list`, `history`
- CI/CD pipeline: tests + lint (ruff) + type checks (mypy) on every push, tag-triggered PyPI publish via Trusted Publishing
- MkDocs Material documentation site
